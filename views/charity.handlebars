        "The professional staff at Simple Fridge provides an option for your charitable. Giving back to your community, either by
        volunteering or spreading awareness for causes in your area, isn’t only an amazing way to connect and help those
        in need, but it’s been scientifically proven to be healthy for you! Those who volunteer have a lower chance of developing
        depression, feel an increased sense of purpose and self-esteem, and release more dopamine from the brain, resulting
        in that feeling of happiness often felt after a good workout. Doctors have even found that those who volunteer tend
        to live longer! It is a simple way to increase your overall health. We have decided to partner with
        <b>The Food Trust</b>. The Food Trust's mission is ensuring that everyone has access to affordable, nutritious food
        and information to make healthy decisions. By working with neighborhoods, schools, grocers, farmers and policymakers,
        they've developed a comprehensive approach to improved food access that combines nutrition education and greater
        availability of affordable, healthy food.
